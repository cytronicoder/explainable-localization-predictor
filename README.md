# Explainable Subcellular Localization Predictor

This is a lightweight, interpretable machine-learning pipeline designed to predict protein subcellular localization from primary amino-acid sequences and reveal the key sequence motifs driving each classification. We combined classical feature‚Äêengineering with a Random Forest classifier and SHAP to generate transparent, biologically meaningful insights.
